## Introduction

The goal of this work is to determine whether or not weather patterns should be considered as supporting input data when making predictions about new daily COVID-19 cases within a given geographical space. Using census, weather, and COVID-19 datasets provided by the Urban Sustain project, the authors attempt to quantify the correlation between particular weather patterns and COVID-19 transmission events.
